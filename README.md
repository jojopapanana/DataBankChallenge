# DataBankChallenge

This is challenge #4 in 8 Weeks SQL Challenge by Danny Ma and it is called Data Bank, which runs just like any other digital bank - but it isn’t only for banking activities, they also have the world’s most secure distributed data storage platform! In this project, there are several parts of question segmented to categories which will be answered using SQL queries. Here is a bit more of the project, quoted straight from the source:

Customers are allocated cloud data storage limits which are directly linked to how much money they have in their accounts. There are a few interesting caveats that go with this business model, and this is where the Data Bank team need your help! The management team at Data Bank want to increase their total customer base - but also need some help tracking just how much data storage their customers will need. This case study is all about calculating metrics, growth and helping the business analyse their data in a smart way to better forecast and plan for their future developments!

Here is the Entity Relationship Diagram for the model:
